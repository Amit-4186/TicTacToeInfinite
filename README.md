# 🎮 TicTacToeInfinite

A simple Tic Tac Toe game — but with a fun twist!

Instead of just playing until the board fills up, each player can only have **3 active moves** on the board. If you try to place a 4th one, your **oldest move disappears**. This keeps the game fresh, strategic, and kind of endless!
